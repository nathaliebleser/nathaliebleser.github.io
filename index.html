          <h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>
          <p>My name is Nathalie Bleser. I have a Master's and Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and am looking for a job.<br/><br/>
            Three words that describe me are: <span title="I like to come up with creative solutions. Creative writing is a hobby of mine.">creative</span>, <span title="I hyperfocus on coding problems">focused</span>, and <span title="I sense other people's emotions and adapt my behaviour accordingly.">empathetic</span>.<br/><br/>
            I love to learn and get bored when I have nothing to learn. For that reason, I have spent years learning to read Japanese. Currently, I spend my free time learning Frontend Development.<br/><br/>
            I'm looking forward to hearing from you!
